## Incredibly simple file transfer


</div>

### Description

This is the simplest way I could find of sending a file across a network or the Internet. You can send any type of file (from text documents to movies) and any size of file. I downloaded many file transfer programs and found them either way too long-winded or quite short but very difficult to understand. Therefore once I understood how to do it I wrote my own program thats not only short, but incredibly simple and capable of sending any type of file (big or small). The code is fully commented and easy to understand. Enjoy...
 
### More Info
 
Run two instances of the program on the same machine while you test it. This just makes things easier.

WAITING: To wait for a file, choose where you want the file to be saved and click "Wait".

SENDING: To send a file, choose the file you want to send and click "Send".
